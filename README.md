# Tech-track-22-23

For this project I had to create. data visualization using D3.js library. I was tasked to use the three methods enter(), update(), exit(). I used the data from [Rijksmuseum API](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/). for my charts.

# Goals

- Clean, transform data with functional programming patterns
- Create interactive visualizations from (external) data
- Use D3 or other frameworks to create interactive visualization(s)
- Work with front-end framework and think in components
- Apply meaningul animation and / or storytelling in your visualization.
- Refactor, debug and read complex programs (code)
